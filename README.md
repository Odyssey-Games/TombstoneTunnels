# TombstoneTunnels

## Ideas

- top-down
- dungeon crawler
- rogue-like
- multiplayer
- co-op -> one team that plays together / maybe also singleplayer -> difficulty scales with player count
- un-dead mobs (skeletons, zombies)
- randomly generated levels
- close-range/melee combat

## Testing

1. Create virtual environment (recommended): `python -m venv env`
2. Activate virtual environment: `.\env\Scripts\activate` (Windows) or `source env/bin/activate` (Unix)
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
